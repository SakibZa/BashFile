# Log File Truncation Script

This bash script is designed to find the largest log file on your computer and truncate it to 100 lines. It can be useful for managing log files and reducing their size while retaining the most recent log entries.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify the log files.
2. Save the script as `bashFile.sh`
3. Run the script: `bash bashFile.sh.`

The script will find the largest log file in the  directory and truncate it to 100 lines using the `tail` command. 

## Note

- Before using this script, ensure that you have a backup of your important log files.
